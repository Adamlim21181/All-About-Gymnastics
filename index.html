            <h2>A bit about Gymnastics</h2>
            <p>&nbsp</p>
            <p>Gymnastics is a sport that requires balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, and endurance. It involves performing a series of movements such as flips, twists, turns and jumps on various apparatus like the balance beam, bars, vault, and floor mat. Gymnastics is a highly skilled and physically demanding sport that requires years of training and practice to perfect. It is a popular sport around the world, with competitions held at local, national, and international levels. Gymnastics is not only a sport but also a form of art that showcases the beauty of human movement and athleticism. There are 3 main types of gymnastics, Artistic, rhythmic and trampoline. </p>

            <p>&nbsp</p>
            <h2>History of Gymnastics</h2>
            <p>&nbsp</p>
            <p>Gymnastics has a long and fascinating history that dates back to ancient Greece. The word "gymnastics" comes from the Greek word "gymnos," which means "naked." This is because the ancient Greeks performed gymnastics in the nude.<br><br>

                The first recorded gymnastics competition was held in Athens in 776 BC. The competition was part of the first Olympic Games and included events like running, jumping, wrestling, and boxing. Gymnastics continued to be an important part of the Olympic Games throughout ancient Greece.<br><br>
                
                During the Middle Ages, gymnastics fell out of favour, but it was revived in the 19th century. This was thanks in part to the work of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, a German physical educator who is considered the father of modern gymnastics. Jahn developed a series of exercises to help strengthen the body and improve overall fitness.<br><br>
                
                Gymnastics grew in popularity throughout the 20th century, with the establishment of gymnastics clubs and the development of new equipment like the balance beam and the vault. Today, gymnastics is a popular sport and is practised by people of all ages around the world
