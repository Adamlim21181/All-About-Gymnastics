            <h2>History of Gymnastics</h2>
            <p>&nbsp</p>
            <p>Gymnastics has a long and fascinating history that dates back to ancient Greece. The word "gymnastics" comes from the Greek word "gymnos," which means "naked." This is because the ancient Greeks performed gymnastics in the nude.<br><br>

                The first recorded gymnastics competition was held in Athens in 776 BC. The competition was part of the first Olympic Games and included events like running, jumping, wrestling, and boxing. Gymnastics continued to be an important part of the Olympic Games throughout ancient Greece.<br><br>
                
                During the Middle Ages, gymnastics fell out of favour, but it was revived in the 19th century. This was thanks in part to the work of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, a German physical educator who is considered the father of modern gymnastics. Jahn developed a series of exercises to help strengthen the body and improve overall fitness.<br><br>
                
                Gymnastics grew in popularity throughout the 20th century, with the establishment of gymnastics clubs and the development of new equipment like the balance beam and the vault. Today, gymnastics is a popular sport and is practised by people of all ages around the world

            <h3>How judges judge Men's Artistic Gymnastics</h3>
            <p>&nbsp</p>
            <p>When judging men's artistic gymnastics, judges take into account a variety of factors to determine the final score.

The score ranges from 0 to 10, with deductions for mistakes and imperfections in the routine. It plays a crucial role in determining the overall score and ranking of the gymnast. The difficulty score is another important factor that the judges consider when evaluating a gymnast's performance in men's artistic gymnastics. This score reflects the level of difficulty of the routine and is determined by the types of skills and combinations of movements performed by the athlete. The difficulty score is added to the execution score to determine the final score for the routine. Judges carefully assess each gymnast's performance to ensure a fair and accurate score is given.<br>
